In this project, you are required to implement part of the PHY layer of a WiMax system; namely “Channel Coding” (QPSK only) as described in section 8.4.9 in WiMax Standard (IEEE Std 802.16-2007). This part of the standard is explained in this document with some numeric examples. WiMax PHY including “Channel Coding” has different parameters that are set by the MAC layer. There are five different blocks within the “Chanel Coding”, each has different parameters that might require several implementations. In this project you are only required to implement one implementation per block.
